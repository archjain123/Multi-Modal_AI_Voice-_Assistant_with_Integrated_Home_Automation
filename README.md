**Home Automation System with ESP32 🔌🏡**
This project is a smart home automation system based on the ESP32 microcontroller. It allows users to control 7 relays via a Python-based voice assistant running on a PC. The system can automate home appliances such as lights, fans, and other electronic devices.

**📌 Features**
ESP32-based automation for seamless device control

7 relay module to control multiple home appliances

Integration with a Python voice assistant for hands-free operation

Custom PCB design (schematic included in the repository)

Secure and efficient communication between PC and ESP32

**🛠️ Components Used**
ESP32 Microcontroller

7-Relay Module

Custom PCB (design files included in the repo)

Power Supply Unit

**🚀 How to Use**
Flash the ESP32 with the provided firmware

Run the Python script on your PC

Control devices using voice commands or a GUI (if implemented)

**📁 Repository Contents**
