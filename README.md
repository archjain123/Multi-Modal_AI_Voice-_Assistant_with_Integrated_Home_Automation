## ✨ Why This Project?
Existing smart assistants are often **expensive**, **locked-down**, and **limited in customization**.  
The **Multi-Modal AI Voice Assistant** changes that by combining:
- **AI-powered natural voice control**
- **Desktop automation tools**
- **Custom PCB-based IoT control**
- **API-driven real-time data**

It’s designed to **adapt to your needs**, whether at home, in the office, or in specialized industrial settings.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Listen** – Wake word triggers listening mode.
2. **Understand** – AI interprets your voice command.
3. **Act** –  
   - **Digital tasks** → Control desktop via Python modules.  
   - **Physical tasks** → Send HTTP commands to ESP32 for relay switching.
4. **Respond** – Spoken confirmation or requested data.
